#IVVI = qt.instruments.create('DAC','IVVI',interface = 'COM4', polarity=['BIP', 'BIP', 'BIP', 'BIP'], numdacs=16)  # Initialize IVVI
#dmm = qt.instruments.create('dmm','a34410a', address = 'USB0::0x0957::0x0607::MY53003401::INSTR')   # Initialize dmm

# Sweeping vector

#bias = 0

# you indicate that a measurement is about to start and other
# processes should stop (like batterycheckers, or temperature
# monitors)
qt.mstart()

# Next a new data object is made.
# The file will be placed in the folder:
# <datadir>/<datestamp>/<timestamp>_testmeasurement/
# and will be called:
# <timestamp>_testmeasurement.dat
# to find out what 'datadir' is set to, type: qt.config.get('datadir')

data = qt.Data(name='5-24 ivg f=72,50MHz By=0,5T')  # Put one space before name


# Now you provide the information of what data will be saved in the
# datafile. A distinction is made between 'coordinates', and 'values'.
# Coordinates are the parameters that you sweep, values are the
# parameters that you readout (the result of an experiment). This
# information is used later for plotting purposes.
# Adding coordinate and value info is optional, but recommended.
# If you don't supply it, the data class will guess your data format.

data.add_value(' Reflection')      # Underline makes the next letter as index

data.add_value('Current [pA]')      # Underline makes the next letter as index

# The next command will actually create the dirs and files, based
# on the information provided above. Additionally a settingsfile
# is created containing the current settings of all the instruments.
data.create_file()

# Getting filepath to the data file
data_path = data.get_dir() 

# Next two plot-objects are created. First argument is the data object
# that needs to be plotted. To prevent new windows from popping up each
# measurement a 'name' can be provided so that window can be reused.
# If the 'name' doesn't already exists, a new window with that name
# will be created. For 3d plots, a plotting style is set.

# It is actually a simple loop.
